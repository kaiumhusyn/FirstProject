                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Rewarding employees who exhibit the mission and core values, enhance the brand and customer-client relationships, or improve operational efficiencies are good alternatives to traditional employee-of-the-month recognitions.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>A vision statement almost sounds mystical. But it’s not supernatural, far from it. Rather, a vision statement is a foundational business document.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Your goal statement should specifically indicate what you need to accomplish. The phrase should use action words like sell, implement, design, build, and so on. The statement must clearly state what you're supposed to achieve and how long you have to achieve it.</p>
